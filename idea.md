**3. Problem Statement**
Video creators often struggle with adding accurate and well-timed subtitles to their content. Manual captioning is time-consuming, prone to human error, and can delay content release. Existing tools are either expensive, overly complex, or lack AI-powered automation. This project aims to simplify and speed up the subtitle creation process for videos.

**4. Proposed Solution / Idea**
A React-based web application that allows users to upload videos, automatically generate subtitles using AI (OpenAI Whisper API), and fine-tune them through an intuitive editor. Users will be able to preview, edit, style, and export subtitles, as well as burn them directly into the video using ffmpeg integration.
